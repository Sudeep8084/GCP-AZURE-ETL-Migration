# GCP-AZURE-ETL-Migration

# GCP & Azure ETL Migration

This project highlights the modernization of legacy ETL workflows by migrating them to scalable cloud-native architectures using GCP (BigQuery, Dataflow) and Azure (Data Lake, Synapse Analytics). The migration improved pipeline performance, resilience, and operational transparency.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Google Cloud Platform: BigQuery, Dataflow
- Microsoft Azure: Azure Data Factory, Azure Synapse
- PySpark, Hive
- Apache Airflow
- SQL, Python

## üîç Project Overview

As a Software Data Engineer at A&A Innovative Solutions:
- Participated in the migration of ETL pipelines from on-prem to GCP and Azure environments.
- Refactored Hive and PySpark jobs to optimize BigQuery ingestion and partitioning strategies.
- Assisted in building standardized validation frameworks to ensure data quality across both platforms.
- Developed reusable components for cross-cloud ingestion to reduce engineering effort.

## üìà Business Impact

- Reduced overall ETL runtimes by 37%.
- Improved data SLA compliance by 23%.
- Enabled real-time analytics capabilities using cloud-native infrastructure.
